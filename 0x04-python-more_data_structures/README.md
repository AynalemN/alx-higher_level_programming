## 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary ##
0. Squared simple - write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
1. Search and replace - Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
	* `my_list` is the initial list
	* `search` is the element to replace in the list
	* `replace`  is the new element
2. Unique addition - Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).
3. Present in both - Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
4. Only differents - Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
5. Number of keys - Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
6. Print sorted dictionary - Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
	* You can assume that all keys are strings
	* Keys should be sorted by alphabetic order
	* Only sort keys of the first level (don’t sort keys of a dictionary inside the main dictionary)
	* Dictionary values can have any type
7. Update dictionary - Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
	* `key` argument will be always a string
	* `value` argument will be any type
	* If a key exists in the dictionary, the value will be replaced
	* If a key doesn’t exist in the dictionary, it will be created
8. Simple delete by key - Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
9. Multiply by 2 - Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2
10. Best score - Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.
